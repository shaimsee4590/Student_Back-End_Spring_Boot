1. JWT (JSON Web Token) Implementation
Add dependencies for JWT in your pom.xml or build.gradle.
Create a utility class for generating and validating JWT tokens.
Implement a custom filter to intercept HTTP requests and validate JWT tokens.
Configure security settings using SecurityConfigurerAdapter to enable JWT-based authentication.
2. Exception Handling
Create a global exception handler using @ControllerAdvice.
Define custom exception classes for handling different types of errors (e.g., ResourceNotFoundException, InvalidInputException).
Use @ExceptionHandler methods to handle exceptions and return meaningful error responses to the client.
3. AWS S3 Bucket Integration
Add the AWS SDK dependencies for S3 in your pom.xml or build.gradle.
Configure AWS credentials using an application.properties or application.yml file or use the AWS Secrets Manager.
Create a service class to handle file uploads and downloads to/from the S3 bucket using the AmazonS3 client.
Implement methods for uploading files, downloading files, and deleting files from the S3 bucket.
4. Swagger UI Integration
Add the Swagger dependencies (e.g., springdoc-openapi-ui).
Configure Swagger using @OpenAPIDefinition or by creating a configuration class.
Access the Swagger UI via http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to view and test your API endpoints.
5. AWS Implementation
In addition to the S3 bucket, you can integrate other AWS services as needed.
Set up an AWS account and configure the necessary IAM roles and permissions.
Use the aws-java-sdk for interacting with other AWS services (e.g., DynamoDB, SQS) if required.
